1. Make the circute according to the "ufo _detector_circute diagrm.png"
 

   //You can refer the schematics also!
2. You should place the SONAR sensor on top of the servo motor.(Can use the glue from the glue stick).

  
3. For the proper allignment of servo and the sonar you can run the code on arduino "calibration.ino" from calibration folder ,And set the correct allignment for the precised accurate reading of sonar.


4.Run the "ufo_dectetor.ino" code from the ufo_dectetor folder.


5.Download the Processing software for run and visualize  the Radar java code "radar.pde"


   //you can download the processing application from this link "https://processing.org/download"//
   //you should connect the cord wire of arduino  in pc while running this .pde file

   
6.For handgesture control of the servo You can use the  "sketch_jul30d.ino" from the handgesture folder


7.From the cpp folder run the test.py from the visual studio code or You can the command prompt to run the python code 


//Now u can use the index finger and thump to adjust the postion of the servo motor ,through output camera.
// If you hold your thump and middle finger the test.py will get terminated , program will close
